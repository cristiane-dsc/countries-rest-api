## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I plan to apply CSS Grid to this project - I still know very little about it. I'll probably switch pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript for ReactJS and Styled Components. That's something I'm not very familiar with and I know it's very useful and practical.
